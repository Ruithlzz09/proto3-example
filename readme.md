## PROTO-3 Example


Note: It generates code boilerplate in javascript and typescript using protoc and protoc plugins as well as using grpc_tools both approach

Inspired from work `https://github.com/Clement-Jean/grpc-node-js-course`


For Static Code Generation
1. `npm run grpc_tool` (uses grpc-tools)
2. `npm run protoc_tool` (uses protoc and protoc plugins)

For Dynamic Code Generation (refer `src/index.js`)
